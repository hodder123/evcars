    content: `## 5 Things to Know Before Buying a Used Tesla in Kamloops

Thinking about joining the electric revolution with a used Tesla? You're not alone. With gas prices fluctuating and environmental concerns growing, more Kamloops drivers are making the switch to electric vehicles. But before you hand over your hard-earned money, here are five crucial things every used Tesla buyer should know.

### 1. Battery Health is Everything

The battery is the heart of any electric vehicle, and Tesla's are no exception. When shopping for a used Tesla, pay close attention to the battery's state of health. A Model 3 or Model Y with 90%+ battery capacity is ideal. Don't just trust the range estimate on the dash—use third-party apps like TeslaFi or Scan My Tesla to get detailed battery data.

**Red flag:** If the seller won't let you check battery health or the range seems significantly lower than advertised for the mileage, walk away.

### 2. Understand the Warranty Situation

Tesla's warranty coverage varies by model year and component:

- **Battery & Drive Unit:** 8 years or 192,000 km (varies by model)
- **Vehicle:** 4 years or 80,000 km (Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty)

Ask for the VIN and verify remaining warranty coverage directly with Tesla. Some earlier Model S and X vehicles may have had their warranties extended due to known issues—worth checking.

### 3. Check for Accident History and Repairs

Like any used car, a clean history report is essential. But with Teslas, there's an extra layer: aluminum body panels and specialized repair requirements. Only Tesla-certified shops can perform certain repairs, and they don't come cheap.

Request a Carfax report and specifically ask about any bodywork. Minor fender benders are usually fine, but structural damage or airbag deployment should make you think twice.

### 4. Charging Infrastructure in Kamloops

Living in Kamloops means you're well-positioned for EV ownership. The city has a growing network of public chargers, and destinations like Vancouver, Kelowna, and the Okanagan are easily reachable with Tesla's Supercharger network.

However, consider your home charging situation. A standard 120V outlet will add about 8 km of range per hour—fine for overnight charging if your daily commute is short. For faster home charging, a 240V outlet (like your dryer uses) will give you 30-50 km per hour.

### 5. Software and Features Transfer

One of Tesla's unique selling points is its over-the-air software updates. However, some features don't transfer with the vehicle:

- **Full Self-Driving (FSD):** This $15,000+ package stays with the original purchaser unless specifically transferred by Tesla
- **Premium Connectivity:** The free trial ends, and you'll need to subscribe ($13.99/month CAD) for live traffic, satellite maps, and streaming

Verify what's included and budget for ongoing subscription costs if you want the full Tesla experience.

### Final Thoughts

Buying a used Tesla can be a smart financial move—you avoid the steep depreciation of a new vehicle while still getting cutting-edge technology. Just do your homework, verify everything, and don't rush the process.

At The EV Store, we specialize in quality used Teslas right here in Kamloops. Every vehicle in our inventory undergoes a comprehensive inspection, and we provide full transparency on battery health, warranty status, and vehicle history.`,

    content: `## Complete Guide to Buying a Used Tesla in Kamloops

Purchasing a used Tesla is an exciting venture into the world of electric vehicles, but it comes with unique considerations. As Kamloops' premier EV dealership, we've helped hundreds of customers navigate the used Tesla market.

### Why Choose a Used Tesla?

**Significant Cost Savings**
Used Teslas typically cost 20-40% less than new models while offering nearly identical performance and features. With Tesla's over-the-air updates, even older models continue receiving new capabilities.

**Environmental Impact**
By choosing pre-owned, you're participating in sustainable consumption while still enjoying zero-emission driving through Kamloops' beautiful Thompson Valley.

**Proven Reliability**
Tesla's electric drivetrains have fewer moving parts than combustion engines, resulting in exceptional longevity when properly maintained.

### Understanding Tesla Model Differences

**Model S (2012-Present)**
The original Tesla sedan offers spacious luxury, longest range options (up to 652 km), available dual-motor all-wheel drive, and continuous updates.

**Model 3 (2017-Present)**
Tesla's volume-selling sedan features compact executive design, excellent efficiency, minimalist interior, and standard Autopilot on most units.

**Model X (2015-Present)**
The falcon-wing SUV offers seating for up to 7 passengers, maximum utility, advanced air filtration, and towing capability up to 5,000 lbs.

**Model Y (2020-Present)**
The compact SUV delivers Model 3 platform with SUV utility, available third-row seating, and versatile hatchback design.

### Critical Inspection Points

**Battery Health and Degradation**
The battery is your most important consideration. Request current maximum range vs. EPA rating. Look for 10-15% degradation as normal for older vehicles. Maximum charge rate testing should approach 250kW on V3 superchargers.

**Autopilot Hardware**
Different hardware generations offer varying capabilities:
- Hardware 1 (2014-2016): Mobileye system, limited features
- Hardware 2 (2016-2019): Tesla system, upgradable
- Hardware 3 (2019+): Full Self-Driving computer standard

**Service History Review**
Request and verify Tesla service records, warranty work performed, recalls completed, accident history, and maintenance compliance.

### Warranty Considerations

Tesla's warranties transfer to new owners:
- Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty: 4 years/80,000 km
- Battery and Drive Unit: 8 years (varies by model)
- Minimum 70% capacity retention guaranteed

### Financial Considerations

Used Tesla prices vary by:
- Model year and mileage
- Battery size and range
- Option packages and features
- Autopilot capability level
- Warranty remaining

Operating cost savings compared to gas vehicles include 70-80% reduction in fuel costs and 40-50% reduction in maintenance.

### Kamloops-Specific Considerations

**Climate Impact**
Our hot summers and cold winters affect EVs. Heat pump-equipped models (2021+) perform better in winter. Expect 20-40% range reduction in cold weather.

**Charging Infrastructure**
Kamloops offers home charging options, Aberdeen Mall Supercharger, downtown Level 2 chargers, and growing destination charging.

    excerpt: 'Learn essential tips for maintaining your EV battery health, maximizing range, and ensuring your electric vehicle serves you well for years to come.',
    content: `## EV Battery Health & Maintenance: Extending Your Electric Vehicle's Life

The battery is the heart of your electric vehicle. With proper maintenance, modern EV batteries can last 15-20 years or more. This guide covers everything Kamloops EV owners need to know about battery health.

### Daily Charging Best Practices

For daily driving, maintain your battery between 20-80%. Above 80% increases stress on battery chemistry, while below 20% causes depth of discharge stress. Reserve 100% charging for long trips only.

**Charging Speed Considerations**
- Level 1 (120V): Slowest, least stressful, ideal for overnight
- Level 2 (240V): Standard for home, good balance of speed and health
- DC Fast Charging: Use strategically for road trips, not daily

### Climate-Specific Care for Kamloops

**Hot Summer Management**
Park in shade whenever possible. Use covered parking structures. Precondition cabin while plugged in to reduce battery drain from AC.

**Cold Weather Battery Care**
Winter temperatures affect EVs significantly. Precondition battery while plugged in to improve efficiency and regenerative braking. Expect 20-40% range reduction in cold weather. Use seat heaters instead of cabin heat when possible.

### Long-Term Battery Health

**Driving Habits That Help**
Avoid repeated hard acceleration. Use Chill Mode for daily driving. Allow battery warm-up before spirited driving. Use one-pedal driving when possible to maximize regenerative braking.

**Monitoring Battery Health**
Track your battery's condition by comparing current range to EPA rating. 10-15% degradation is normal over several years. Watch for sudden drops in range or charging speed degradation.

### Tesla Battery Warranty

Tesla provides comprehensive coverage:
- Model S and Model X: 8 years/unlimited km, minimum 70% capacity
- Model 3 and Model Y Long Range: 8 years/192,000 km
- Model 3 and Model Y Standard: 8 years/160,000 km

Real-world data shows Tesla batteries typically last 300,000-500,000 km with 85-90% capacity remaining at high mileage.
